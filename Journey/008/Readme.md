# Availability Zones, Region Pairs and SLA agreements

## Cloud Research

- went through the benefits of Region pairs

  1. If one region goes down, the service will fail over to the neighbour region (300 miles away) to pick up the slack
  2. Software updates are rolled out by region, so if one service is down, then the other region will pick up the slack
  3. Data continues to reside within the same region which helps a lot with legal requirements and tax law

- SLAs are service level agreements for each service
  - they have a number of characteristics
    1. Performance Targets
    2. Up-time and connectivity guarantees
    3. Service credits if SLA req's are not met
  - multiple services form a composite SLA
