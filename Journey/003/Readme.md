# Finished Text Analytics API Module

## Cloud Research

- Added Javascript to send messages to the Text Analytics API and check the sentiment score. Based on the score it will send it to 1 of 3 sentiment queues

- Learned how the storage works in Azure and getting more familiar with the interface

- I understand I need to brush up on my Javascript and it can't hurt to do the Azure Foundations next to get my foundation before jumping head first into things. Even if it's easy, there will be a few things I can pickup
