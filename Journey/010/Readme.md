# Dashboards and RAW compute power

## Cloud Research

- Learned how to work with the Azure dashboard

  - creating one for clients, cloning them, deleting them, customizing them

- Started the Azure Compute module
  Learned about the 4 main compute techniques including

  1. VMs - just a mimic of a computer
  2. App Service - great for web apps, a PAAS offering from Azure
  3. Serverless - great for running code, fire it up and run your code, no setup required
  4. Containers - same as VM's but multiple containers are running with one OS

- Learned about VM's
  - Scale Sets - lets you scale up and down depending on demand. The number of identical VMs running can automatically scale based on demand
  - Availablity sets - to avoid one point of failure. if one shuts down the other one will pickup the load
  - Batch - lets you fire up 100s, 1000s of VMs to run a huge batch of processes. Great for when you need RAW compute power. It will automatically scale down as processes finish off with nothing left in the queue.
