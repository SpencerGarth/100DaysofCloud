# Working with Azure Text Analytics API

## Cloud Research

Deployed Azure Text Analytics API and tested post requests to check for different things within the text including

- Language Type
- Entities
- Key Phrases
- and Sentiment

I also created a queue function in order to build an application to use this API. Did not finish, but will pick back up tomorrow!
